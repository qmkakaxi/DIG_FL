##  DIGFL: Efficient Participant Contribution Evaluation for Horizontal and Vertical Federated Learning

DIGFL is an efficient participant contribution evaluation for horizontal and vertical Federated Learning.


Here, we persent two versions: clusterBeta and standaloneBeta.

### standaloneBeta.

#### StandaloneBeta is a stand-alone version,to compare the DIGFL with actual shapley value.

Please refer to [standaloneBeta](https://github.com/qmkakaxi/DIG_FL/tree/master/standaloneBeta).

 ### clusterBeta
#### ClusterBeta is used to deploy in real FL systems, and can perform federated learning training and contribution calculations on multiple machines or edge devices.

Please refer to [clusterBeta](https://github.com/qmkakaxi/DIG_FL/tree/master/clusterBeta).

### If you want the MOTOR and REAL dataset, please contact us.
